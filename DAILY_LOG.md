# Algorithm Visualizer - Daily Development Diary

## Day 1 - September 17, 2025

**What I Did Today:**
- Created complete project folder structure (backend, frontend, data, docs)
- Set up virtual environment and resolved PowerShell execution policy issues
- Installed Flask, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn dependencies
- Initialized git repository and made first commit

**What I Learned:**
- PowerShell execution policies can block script activation
- Virtual environments isolate project dependencies effectively
- Project structure planning is crucial before coding begins

**Challenges Faced:**
- PowerShell wouldn't run venv activation scripts initially
- Had to use Set-ExecutionPolicy to enable script execution
- Learning Windows-specific commands vs Linux commands

**Tomorrow's Plan:**
- Create basic Flask application with routing
- Build landing page HTML template
- Add CSS styling for professional appearance
- Test web server functionality

**Time Spent:** 1.5 hours

## Day 2 - September 18, 2025

**What I Did Today:**
- Created Flask application with proper template/static folder structure
- Built landing page with professional gradient styling
- Added algorithm selection page foundation
- Configured static file serving and tested routing

**What I Learned:**
- Flask template_folder and static_folder configuration for custom paths
- CSS glass-morphism effects with backdrop-filter
- url_for() function for proper static file linking in templates

**Challenges Faced:**
- Initial CSS files weren't loading due to incorrect static path configuration
- Had to understand Flask's static file serving mechanism
- Browser caching required hard refresh to see CSS changes

**Tomorrow's Plan:**
- Adapt DataProcessor from network analysis project to LearningProcessor
- Create user interaction tracking system
- Set up basic data storage for user behavior analytics
- Test interaction capture functionality

**Time Spent:** 1.5 hours
