# Algorithm Visualizer - Daily Development Diary

## Day 1 - September 17, 2025

**What I Did Today:**
- Created complete project folder structure (backend, frontend, data, docs)
- Set up virtual environment and resolved PowerShell execution policy issues
- Installed Flask, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn dependencies
- Initialized git repository and made first commit

**What I Learned:**
- PowerShell execution policies can block script activation
- Virtual environments isolate project dependencies effectively
- Project structure planning is crucial before coding begins

**Challenges Faced:**
- PowerShell wouldn't run venv activation scripts initially
- Had to use Set-ExecutionPolicy to enable script execution
- Learning Windows-specific commands vs Linux commands

**Tomorrow's Plan:**
- Create basic Flask application with routing
- Build landing page HTML template
- Add CSS styling for professional appearance
- Test web server functionality

**Time Spent:** 1.5 hours

## Day 2 - September 18, 2025

**What I Did Today:**
- Created Flask application with proper template/static folder structure
- Built landing page with professional gradient styling
- Added algorithm selection page foundation
- Configured static file serving and tested routing

**What I Learned:**
- Flask template_folder and static_folder configuration for custom paths
- CSS glass-morphism effects with backdrop-filter
- url_for() function for proper static file linking in templates

**Challenges Faced:**
- Initial CSS files weren't loading due to incorrect static path configuration
- Had to understand Flask's static file serving mechanism
- Browser caching required hard refresh to see CSS changes

**Tomorrow's Plan:**
- Adapt DataProcessor from network analysis project to LearningProcessor
- Create user interaction tracking system
- Set up basic data storage for user behavior analytics
- Test interaction capture functionality

**Time Spent:** 1.5 hours

# Algorithm Visualizer - Daily Development Diary

## Day 3 - September 19, 2025

### What I Did Today:
- **Implemented bubble sort algorithm backend** with complete step-by-step execution tracking
- **Created working Flask API endpoint** (`/api/bubble-sort`) that returns JSON data for frontend visualization
- **Built interactive visualization page** with start/stop/reset controls and speed adjustment slider
- **Fixed Flask routing issues** - resolved Python import path problems causing "Not Found" errors
- **Added user interaction tracking system** using simple JSON file logging for analytics
- **Researched UI theme redesign** - explored glassmorphism design patterns for professional appearance
- **Planned dual theme architecture** for college students (professional) vs school students (playful)

### What I Learned:
- **Flask module imports** require `sys.path.append()` when using custom project structure outside standard Python paths
- **JavaScript fetch API debugging** needs proper error handling to identify backend connection issues
- **CSS glassmorphism effects** use `backdrop-filter: blur()` combined with `rgba()` backgrounds for realistic glass appearance
- **User interaction tracking** can start simple with file-based logging before implementing database solutions
- **Project scope management** is crucial - dual themes are ambitious but technically feasible with shared backend
- **Theme switching implementation** can be handled at Flask routing level without duplicating backend logic

### Challenges Faced:
- **Flask import errors** initially prevented algorithm modules from loading - required systematic path debugging
- **API connection failures** caused visualization button to not work - needed step-by-step troubleshooting
- **Basic theme appearance** looks unprofessional for portfolio presentation and graduate school applications
- **Audience targeting complexity** - balancing sophisticated design with age-appropriate accessibility
- **Feature scope creep** - managing ambitious ideas while maintaining focus on core visualization functionality

### Tomorrow's Plan:
- **Implement glassmorphism theme** using greenish-blue color palette for professional college version
- **Update all template files** (index.html, algorithms.html, bubble-sort.html) with new modern design system
- **Organize CSS architecture** for maintainable theme system with shared base styles
- **Add second algorithm** (Selection Sort) to expand visualizer capabilities beyond single implementation
- **Create theme switching infrastructure** for seamless dual UI approach

### Time Spent:
**2.5 hours** (exceeded daily 1.5-hour target due to UI redesign research)

### Technical Achievements:
- ✅ Complete bubble sort algorithm with JSON API
- ✅ Interactive web interface with controls
- ✅ User behavior tracking foundation
- ✅ Professional development debugging skills
- ✅ UI/UX design research and planning

### Next Session Priorities:
1. Theme implementation (glassmorphism college version)
2. CSS organization and maintainable structure
3. Second algorithm addition for expanded functionality
4. Theme switching mechanism development
